# Comparative Genomic Analysis of Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) Strains

## Overview
This repository contains the (original) published paper, a portion of its reproduced data and analysis scripts as well as a power point presentation for the comparative genomic analysis of 11 uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* (UPEC) strains isolated from two tertiary hospitals in Dhaka and Sylhet, Bangladesh. The analysis focuses on the genomic characteristics of these strains and their comparison to other available UPEC strains.

## Repository Structure
- `/data`: This directory contains reproduced data files.
- `/code`: This directory contains the scripts for data processing and heatmap generation.
- `/results`: This directory contains the output of the analyses, including heatmap images.

## Usage
Instructions on how to run the analysis scripts and reproduce table 3 and the heatmaps are provided in the `code` directory.
