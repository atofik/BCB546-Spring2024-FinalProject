# Comparative Genomic Analysis of Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) Strains

## Overview
This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for the comparative genomic analysis of 11 uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* (UPEC) strains isolated from two tertiary hospitals in Dhaka and Sylhet, Bangladesh. The analysis focuses on the genomic characteristics of these strains and their comparison to other available UPEC strains.

## Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST)
The MLST analysis confirmed the strains belong to ST59, ST131, ST219, ST361, ST410, ST448, and ST4204, with one isolate classified as a previously undocumented sequence type.

## Antibiotic Resistance Genes
De novo identification of antibiotic resistance genes including **blaNDM-5**, **blaNDM-7**, **blaCTX-M-15**, and **blaOXA-1** was performed.

## Virulence Analysis
Phenotypic-genotypic analysis of virulence revealed significant heterogeneity within UPEC phylogroups.

## Data Visualization
Heatmaps are used to visualize the data, highlighting the distribution of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes among the different strains.

### Heatmap Generation
The `heatmap.R` script in the `scripts` directory can be used to generate heatmaps from the processed data.

## Repository Structure
- `/data`: This directory contains the raw and processed data files.
- `/code`: This directory contains the R scripts for data processing and heatmap generation.
- `/results`: This directory contains the output of the analyses, including heatmap images.

## Usage
Instructions on how to run the analysis scripts and reproduce the heatmaps are provided in the `scripts` directory.
