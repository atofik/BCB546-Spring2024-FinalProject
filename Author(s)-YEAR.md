# Genotype–Phenotype Correlation of β-Lactamase-Producing Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) Strains from Bangladesh

## Original Study
The original study conducted by Hossain et al. (2024) represents the first comparative analysis of the draft genome sequences of 11 uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* (UPEC) strains isolated from tertiary hospitals in Dhaka and Sylhet, Bangladesh. The study focused on comparing the genomic characteristics of these strains to each other and to other available UPEC strains.

### Key Findings
- The strains belong to sequence types ST59, ST131, ST219, ST361, ST410, ST448, and ST4204.
- Identification of antibiotic resistance genes blaNDM-5, blaNDM-7, blaCTX-M-15, and blaOXA-1.
- Significant heterogeneity was observed within UPEC phylogroups in terms of virulence.

## Replication Study
This repository contains the data, analysis scripts, and results of the replication study. The replication was focused on verifying the original findings and exploring the genotype-phenotype correlations using updated bioinformatics tools and methods.

### Methodology
- **Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST)**: The MLST analysis was replicated using the `mlst` software with the latest database updates.
- **Antibiotic Resistance Genes Identification**: The resistance genes were re-identified using the `abricate` tool against multiple databases including CARD, ResFinder, and NCBI AMRFinderPlus.
- **Virulence Analysis**: The virulence factors were analyzed using the `vfdb` tool to compare phenotypic and genotypic data.

### Data Visualization
- Heatmaps were generated using the `pheatmap` package in R to visualize the distribution of resistance genes and virulence factors.
- The code for generating heatmaps is available in the `scripts` directory.

## Results Summary
The replication study confirmed the original findings and provided additional insights into the distribution of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes among the UPEC strains. The heatmaps facilitated a clear visual representation of the data, highlighting the heterogeneity within the phylogroups.

## Conclusion
The replication study supports the original conclusions drawn by Hossain et al. (2024) and underscores the importance of continuous surveillance of UPEC strains for better understanding their evolution and spread of resistance.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to obtain the datasets and scripts.
- Follow the instructions in the `scripts` directory to replicate the analysis and generate heatmaps.
