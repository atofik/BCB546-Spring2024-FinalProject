- This file introduces the original paper, explains the technical details of the replication analyses, and summarizes the replication of the original results.

## Original study
- The original study conducted by Hossain et al. (2020) represents the first comparative analysis of the draft genome sequences of 11 uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* (UPEC) strains isolated from tertiary hospitals in Dhaka and Sylhet, Bangladesh.
- The study focused on comparing the genomic characteristics of these strains to each other and to other available UPEC strains.

### Key findings
- The strains belong to sequence types ST59, ST131, ST219, ST361, ST410, ST448, and ST4204.
- Identification of antibiotic resistance genes blaNDM-5, blaNDM-7, blaCTX-M-15, and blaOXA-1.
- Significant heterogeneity was observed within UPEC phylogroups in terms of virulence.

## Technical details of the replication analyses
- A porition of the original data was reproduced and analysed.
- The replication focused on verifying the original findings and exploring the genotype-phenotype correlations using updated bioinformatics tools and methods.

### Methodology
- The analyses were replicated using the accession numbers from the original paper in conjuction with the latest online databases to generate raw data.
- The generated raw data was analysed using Iowa State HPC nova cluster using unix commands to reproduce Table 3.
- Python and R programming were used to reproduce two heatmaps.

## Results summary
- The replication study (confirmed a portion of the) original findings and provided additional insights into the distribution of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes among the UPEC strains. 
- Table 3 illustrated the some slight variations between the original findings and reproduced data.
- The heatmaps facilitated a clear visual contrast between the original and reproduced data.

## Conclusion
- The replication study supports the original conclusions drawn by Hossain et al. (2020) and underscores the importance of continuous surveillance of UPEC strains for a better understanding of their evolution and spread of resistance.
